Gamepad - Handle and configure game controller events

========================================================================
Sample Description:

The Gamepad sample is an application that demonstrates how to handle
gamepad and joystick events. It can handle two connected game controllers
at once.

When an HID game controller is connected to the device, a collection of
buttons and analog sticks representing the controller will be drawn.
This "virtual" gamepad will react to input events from the controller.
Tapping a virtual button on the screen, then pressing a physical button
on the gamepad, allows the buttons to be re-assigned -- much like a game
would allow players to change how it is controlled.

Feature summary:
- Discovery of gamepad and joystick devices which are already connected.
- Handling of controller connect and disconnect events.
- Handling of controller input events.
- Configuration of controller buttons.
